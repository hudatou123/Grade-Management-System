Data Access Object

DAO stands for Data Access Object. It's a design pattern that separates database operations from the rest of the application.

In this project, DAO acts as a bridge between the user interface and the database. Instead of writing SQL code directly in the UI classes, I create separate DAO classes to handle all database operations. This makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

 Illustration of these 4 DAO Classes:
  1.UserDAO - Handles user login and user account management
  2.TeacherDAO - Manages teacher information (add, update, delete, search)
  3.StudentDAO - Manages student records (add, update, delete, search)
  4.GradeDAO - Manages student grades (add, update, delete, calculate averages)
